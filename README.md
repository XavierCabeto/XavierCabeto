I am very curious and enthusiastic about Computer Science, I am graduating in Computer Engineering. I have experience with Competitive Programming, as well as Web Development, experiences in writing computer programs to solve Competitive Programming problems, from Algorithms, Data Structures, Mathematics and Logic problems during my high school education at Instituto de Telecomunicações - ITEL (currently I really want to solve real world problems by writing computer programs).
